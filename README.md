# PasswordGeneratorV1.0
Generates randomly generated passwords (Inspired by LastPass)
- Allows user to choose if the password will include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or symbols
- Ping (Option 2)

# How to use
- Choose option 1
- Input desired password length
- Specify if you want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols using "y" or "n"
---
"0" to exit program when you're on the menu screen

# Limitations
- Case sensitive (y/n) I did this on purpose though, I don't really know why
- Possibility of having only one type of character. Ex. All lowercase
- Not much customizability

# Notes to myself
I wrote these in the code itself, but moved it to the readme because cleanliness
---
### Notes for next iteration
- Possible to make password that should have more then just letters, but just happened to only select letters
- therefore: keep lists seperate, but have a 25% chance of selecting each list, then select random number based on list length
- Make check once completed, if list does not contain at least 1 of each, then rerun the function
- Can add option to select how many of each type of char desired, or ability to make it completely random
- Also more possible changes for later versions, allow user to select at least how many of each type of char
- Possibly just make the next version on the same program, just make it the new option 2, 3, etc.
- Not case sensitive (y/n)?
